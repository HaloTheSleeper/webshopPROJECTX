PROJECT X by HaloTheSleeper

SHORT DESCRIPTION
Project X is the first bigger project of mine, a webshop with some interesting features.
Basically a React website which uses Commerce.js and a small self built server 
(which runs on localhost) to give customers the ability to order custom logos from infinite 
amount of creators. The project isn't ready to be put into action yet, nor do I have a 
interest for doing that, it's rather an study project not a webshop made for making profit.

"HOW IT CAME TO BE"
I wanted to learn web development and thought React would be a great idea as I had a bit of previous knowledge
and also the plan to better my understanding of vanilla CSS, JS and HTML. I started of a Youtube tutorial which 
explained how to build a fully functional webshop with React and Commerce.js (link: https://youtu.be/377AQ0y6LPA).
Finished that and realized I wanted to get the project further and started to add features, better design, a backend and etc to it.
The "final" piece's source code stands before You right here.

PLANS FOR THE FUTURE
Im planning to add server side rendering to the project with Next.js, rewrite the code to be more understandable, 
delete unnecessary code, better safety overall (encryption for "sensitive data", protection against common attacks, etc) get the webshop ready for potential real world use 
and finally upload it to a hosting platform.
